## [project1](code\project1\popularVenues_Toronto.ipynb)
 **popularVenues_Toronto** - Few selected Boroughs of Toronto, Canada are analysed for the top venue categories across each neighborhood within the Boroughs. The identified top venue categories are clustered based on venue category similarity across each neighborhood.

## [project2](code\project2\marketHotspots_Helsinki.ipynb)
**marketHotspots_Helsinki** - Extended the *popularVenues_Toronto* strategy towards an imaginary business problem of allocating profitable locations within the districts of Helsinki, Finland for a chain of Indian restaurants. Possible restaurant hot-spots are identified and visualized based on:
* absence of other Indian restaurants in entire district
* absence of other Indian restaurants within popular venues
